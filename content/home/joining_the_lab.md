<p align="justify" style="color:white">If you are interested in contributing to, working with, or joining the <b>Sleep Evolution Group</b> in any capacity please reach out to <a href="mailto:max.shafer@gmail.com">Dr. Maxwell (Max) Shafer</a>. In general, my training philosophy is to provide each trainee with opportunities to learn and attain the skills they require for their chosen career path, and to provide a welcoming and safe place to excel.</p>

<br>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">If you are interested in a postdoctoral position, unless otherwise posted, it is typically required to apply to external funding. There are multiples sources available from the University (including the Data Sciences Institute, and  the Faculty of Arts & Science, among others) and the Federal and Provincial Governments in Canada (eg NSERC and CIHR). Funding is also available from some international agencies (e.g. HFSP, Marie-Curie), and for citizens of specific countries (USA, China, etc). If you join my lab as a Postdoctoral fellow, my philosophy is to guide and help you design a competitive and fund-able research program, therefore, I am happy to work with soon-to-be PhD graduates to design a project and apply for funding.</p>

<br>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">Graduate students can currently apply through the Cell & Systems Biology graduate program at either the MSc or PhD levels. Please reach out to Max as early as possible to discuss opportunities and available projects. If you are an international applicant, please be aware that there are limited and very competitive spots in the program for non-Canadian residents (or permanent residents).</p>

<br>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">I am typically interested in hosting 1-3 undergraduate students per academic cycle (depending on availability of projects). These can be in the form of the <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/research-opportunities/research-opportunities-program#how-to-apply-accordion-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research Opportunities Program</a>,  through an independent project in CSB (CSB497/498), or through the NSERC USRA program. Interested students should reach out Max as early as possible to discuss interests and the potential availability of projects.</p>
