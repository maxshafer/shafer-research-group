<p align="justify">The biological mechanisms that regulate sleep are conserved across vertebrates, yet sleep displays remarkable variation both across and within species. <b>Why do animals display remarkable variation in sleep, and what genes and cell types drive such variation?</b>

<br>

We study the evolution and genomics of sleep variation across ~~fish~~ *_animals_* using a two-pronged macro- and micro-evolutionary approach. We leverage the amazing diversity in sleep related phenotypes that we have discovered across both <b>African cichlid fish</b> (micro-evolution), and across the larger radiations of <b>bony and cartilaginous fishes</b> (macro-evolution).</p>
