What is the evolutionary history of sleep timing in fish and other vertebrates? What genomic, ecological, or paleontological events are associated with shifts in sleep timing in over >400my of vertebrate evolution?

<!--more-->

We are interested in using macro-evolutionary, and macro-genomic comparisons and approaches to identify and understand general principles for sleep and activity pattern evolution across vertebrates. Particularly, we leverage the extensive diversity of sleep-timing observed across fish groups (bony and cartilaginous fish).
